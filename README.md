# Nino Nina AustinTX


# Question: How does el Nino and Nina affect average temperature, rainfall, the edwards aquifer recharge rate, Lake Travis water level, and electricity cost.

Project-1 Of the UT Austin Data Analysis bootcamp. In this project we focus on analysing the effect that el Nino and La Nina have across the Austin metro area (Travis and Williamson county) and how it affects:
1. Temperature
2. Rainfall
3. Water Recharge Rate of the Edwards aquifer
5. Water levels in Lake Travis
6. Electrical cost in KWh


Our Methodology this data we Did the Following:

1. Temperature
   
3. Rainfall
   
4. Water Recharge Rate of the Edwards aquifer

   
6. Water levels in Lake Travis:
Pulled historical water levels going back to 1940 from the Lower Colorado River Authority. This Data measure several daily time stamps. This was too granular for our needs so I Filtered out the data to only use the first measurement of each month. Once this was filtered. I grab the years from 

8. Electrical cost in kWh:
